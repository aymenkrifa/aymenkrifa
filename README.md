# Hi, I'm Aymen 👋

I’m a Machine Learning engineer at Quicktext, where we're pretty much at [the top of our game when it comes to AI in the hospitality sector](https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4108013.html). We're the brains behind Velma, the innovative virtual assistant.

I'm all about coding away with a cup of coffee until the early hours of the morning rather than waking up with sufficient sleep. I prefer to focus on creating the best products possible instead of just launching something. I believe in well-thought-out planning, logical outcomes, and pure hard work instead of "chasing my dreams". In a nutshell, I'm all about getting things done.

I grew up on the internet and started coding at 15. After completing my degree in Software engineering (Licence) in 2022, I joined the Quicktext team specializing in developing end-to-end Machine Learning systems. Currently residing in Sousse, I also enjoy creating helpful side projects in my spare time.
